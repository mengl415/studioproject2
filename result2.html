    <h1 class="title">On Punctuation</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
      There are <span class="largeText">"some"</span> punctuations that are <span class="largeText">"interesting"</span> and there are <span class="largeText"></span>some
      punctuations that are <span class="largeText">"not"</span>. Let us begin with the punctuations that are
      <span class="largeText">"not"</span>. Of these, the one, but the first and the most, the completely most
      <span class="largeText">"uninteresting"</span>, is the <span class="largeText">"question"</span> mark. The <span class="largeText">"question"</span> mark is <span class="largeText">"alright"</span> when it
      is all alone, when it is used as a brand on cattle, or when it could be used
      in <span class="largeText">"decoration"</span>, but connected with writing, it is completely, entirely,
      completely, <span class="largeText">"uninteresting"</span>. It is evident, that is, you ask a "question," you ask
      a <span class="largeText">"question"</span>, but anybody who can read at all knows when a "question" is a
      <span class="largeText">"question"</span> as it is written in writing. Therefore, I ask you, therefore,
      wherefore should one use the <span class="largeText">"question"</span> mark? Beside it does not, in its form,
      go with <span class="largeText">"ordinary"</span> printing, and so it pleases neither the <span class="largeText">"eye"</span> nor the <span class="largeText">"ear"</span>,
      and it is therefore like a noun, just an <span class="largeText">"unnecessary"</span> name of something. A
      "question" is a <span class="largeText">"question"</span>; anybody can know that a "question" is a <span class="largeText">"question"</span>, and
      so why add to it the <span class="largeText">"question"</span> mark when it is already there, when the
      <span class="largeText">"question"</span> is already there in the writing. Therefore, I never could bring
      myself to use a <span class="largeText">"question"</span> mark. I always found it positively revolting, and
      now, very few do use it. <span class="largeText">"Exclamation"</span> marks have the same difficulty and
      also quotation mark: they are <span class="largeText">"unnecessary"</span>, they are <span class="largeText">"ugly"</span>, they spoil the
      line of the writing or the printing, and anyway, what is the use if you do
      not know that a "question" is a <span class="largeText">"question"</span>? What is the use of its being a
      <span class="largeText">"question"</span>? The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began
      writing, I found it simply impossible to use <span class="largeText">"question"</span> marks and <span class="largeText">"quotation"</span>
      marks and <span class="largeText">"exclamation"</span> points, and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps
      <span class="largeText">"some"</span> day they will see it some other way, but not at any rate <span class="largeText">"anybody"</span> can
      and does see it that way.<br><br>

      So there are the <span class="largeText">"uninteresting"</span> things in punctuation <span class="largeText">"uninteresting"</span> in a way 
      that is perfectly <span class="largeText">"obvious"</span> and so we do
      not have to <span class="largeText">go"</span> any farther into that There are besides <span class="largeText">"dashes"</span> and <span class="largeText">"dots"</span>
      and these might be <span class="largeText">"interesting"</span> spaces might be interesting They <span class="largeText">"might"</span> if
      one <span class="largeText">"felt"</span> that way about them<br><br>

      One <span class="largeText">"other"</span> little punctuation mark one can have <span class="largeText">"feelings"</span> about and that is 
      the <span class="largeText">"apostrophe"</span> for <span class="largeText">"possession"</span> Well <span class="largeText">"feel"</span>
      as you like about that <span class="largeText">"I"</span> can see and I <span class="largeText">"do"</span> see that for <span class="largeText">"many"</span> that for some
      the <span class="largeText">"possessive"</span> case apostrophe has a <span class="largeText">"gentle"</span> tender insinuation that makes
      it <span class="largeText">"very"</span> difficult to definitely decide to <span class="largeText">"do"</span> without it One does do
      <span class="largeText">"without"</span> it I do I mostly <span class="largeText">"always"</span> do but I cannot <span class="largeText">"deny"</span> that from time to
      time I feel myself having <span class="largeText">"regrets"</span> and from time to time I put it in to
      make the <span class="largeText">"possessive"</span> case I <span class="largeText">"absolutely"</span> do not like it and leaving it out I
      feel no <span class="largeText">"regret"</span> there it is unnecessary and not <span class="largeText">"ornamental"</span> but inside a
      word and its s well perhaps perhaps it <span class="largeText">"does"</span> appeal by its <span class="largeText">"weakness"</span> to
      your weakness At least at <span class="largeText">"any"</span> rate from time to time I <span class="largeText">"do"</span> find myself
      letting it <span class="largeText">"alone"</span> if it has come in and <span class="largeText">"sometimes"</span> it has come in I cannot
      positively <span class="largeText">"deny"</span> but that I do from time to time let it <span class="largeText">"come"</span> in<br><br>

      So <span class="largeText">"now"</span> to come to the <span class="largeText">"real"</span> question of <span class="largeText">"punctuation"</span> periods commas colons
      semi colons and capitals and small <span class="largeText">"letters"</span><br><br>
      
      I have had a <span class="largeText">"long"</span> and <span class="largeText">"complicated"</span> life with all these<br><br>
      
      Let us <span class="largeText">"begin"</span> with these I use the <span class="largeText">"least"</span> first and these are <span class="largeText">"colons"</span> and 
      <span class="largeText">"semi colons"</span> one might add to these commas<br><br>

      When I <span class="largeText">"first"</span> began writing I felt that writing <span class="largeText">"should"</span> go on I <span class="largeText">"still"</span> do
      feel that it should go on <span class="largeText">"but"</span> when I first began writing I was <span class="largeText">"completely"</span>
      possessed by the <span class="largeText">necessity</span> that writing should go <span class="largeText">"on"</span> and on and if writing
      should go on <span class="largeText">"what"</span> had colons and commas to do with it <span class="largeText">"what"</span> had periods to
      do with it <span class="largeText">"what"</span> had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with
      writing going <span class="largeText">"on"</span> which was at that time the most <span class="largeText">"profound"</span> need I had in
      connection with writing What had colons and semi colons <span class="largeText">"to do"</span> with it
      what had commas <span class="largeText">"to do"</span>  with it what had periods <span class="largeText">"to do"</span> with it<br><br>
      
      What had
      periods <span class="largeText">"to do"</span> with it Inevitably no matter <span class="largeText">"how"</span> completely I had to have
      writing go on <span class="largeText">"physically"</span> one had to again and again <span class="largeText">"stop"</span> sometime and if
      one had to <span class="largeText">"again"</span> and again stop sometime and if one had to again and again
      <span class="largeText">"stop"</span> some time then <span class="largeText">periods</span> had to exist Beside I had <span class="largeText">"always"</span> like the
      look of periods and I <span class="largeText">"liked"</span> what they did <span class="largeText">"Stopping"</span> sometime did not
      really keep one from <span class="largeText">"going"</span> on it was nothing that <span class="largeText">"interfered"</span> it was only
      something that happened and as it happened as a <span class="largeText">"perfectly"</span> natural
      happening I did not <span class="largeText">"believe"</span> in periods and I used them I really <span class="largeText">"never"</span>
      stopped using them<br><br>

      Beside that <span class="largeText">"periods"</span> might later come to have a <span class="largeText">"life"</span> of
      their own to <span class="largeText">"commence"</span> breaking up things in <span class="largeText">"arbitrary"</span> ways that has
      happened <span class="largeText">"lately"</span> with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way
      <span class="largeText">"later"</span> I will read you a little of it By the time I had <span class="largeText">"written"</span> this poem
      about three years ago periods had come to have for me <span class="largeText">"completely"</span> a life of
      their own They could <span class="largeText">"begin"</span> to act as they thought <span class="largeText">"best"</span> and one might
      <span class="largeText">"interrupt"</span> one s writing with them that is not really <span class="largeText">"interrupt"</span> one s
      writing with them but one could come to <span class="largeText">"stop"</span> arbitrarily stop at times in
      one s writing and so they could be <span class="largeText">"used"</span> and you could use them Periods
      could come to <span class="largeText">"exist"</span> in this way and they could come in this way to have a
      <span class="largeText">"life"</span> of their own They did not serve you in any <span class="largeText">"servile"</span> way as commas and
      colons and semi colons do Yes you do <span class="largeText">"feel"</span> what I mean<br><br>
      
      Periods have a
      <span class="largeText">"life"</span> of their own a <span class="largeText">"necessity"</span> of their own a <span class="largeText">"feeling"</span> of their own a <span class="largeText">"time"</span>
      of their own And that <span class="largeText">"feeling"</span> that <span class="largeText">"life"</span> that <span class="largeText">"necessity"</span> that <span class="largeText">"time"</span> can
      express itself in an <span class="largeText">"infinite"</span> variety that is the reason that I have
      always remained <span class="largeText">"true"</span> to periods so much so that as I say recently I <span class="largeText">"have"</span>
      felt that one could <span class="largeText">"need"</span> them more than one had ever needed them<br><br>
      
      You can
      <span class="largeText">"see"</span> what an entirely <span class="largeText">"different"</span> thing a period is from a comma a colon or
      a semi colon<br><br>
      
      There are two <span class="largeText">"different"</span> ways of thinking about colons and
      semicolons you can <span class="largeText">"think"</span> of them as commas and as such they are <span class="largeText">"purely"</span>
      servile or you can <span class="largeText">"think"</span> of them as periods and then using them can make
      you feel <span class="largeText">"adventurous"</span> I can see that one might feel about them as <span class="largeText">"periods"</span>
      but I myself never have I began <span class="largeText">"unfortunately"</span> to feel them as a <span class="largeText">"comma"</span> and
      commas are <span class="largeText">"servile"</span> they have no life of their own they are <span class="largeText">"dependent"</span> upon
      use and convenience and they are put there just for <span class="largeText">"practical"</span> purposes
      Semi colons and colons <span class="largeText">"had"</span> for me from the first <span class="largeText">""</span>completely this character
      the <span class="largeText">"character"</span> that a comma has and not the character that a period has and
      therefore and <span class="largeText">"definitely"</span> I have never used them But now <span class="largeText">"dimly"</span> and
      definitely I do see that they might well <span class="largeText">"possibly"</span> they might have in them
      something of the <span class="largeText">"character"</span> of the period and so it might have been an
      <span class="largeText">"adventure"</span> to use them I really do not think so I <span class="largeText">"think"</span> however lively
      they are or <span class="largeText">"disguised"</span> they are they are <span class="largeText">"definitely"</span> more comma than period
      and so really I cannot <span class="largeText">"regret"</span> not having used them They are more <span class="largeText">"powerful"</span>
      more <span class="largeText">"imposing"</span> more <span class="largeText">"pretentious"</span> than a comma but they are a <span class="largeText">"comma"</span> all the
      same They really have within them <span class="largeText">"deeply"</span> within them fundamentally within
      them the comma <span class="largeText">"nature"</span> And now what does a comma <span class="largeText">"do"</span> and <span class="largeText">"what"</span> has it to do
      and <span class="largeText">"why"</span> do I feel as I do about them<br><br>
      
      What <span class="largeText">"does"</span> a comma do<br><br>
      
      I have <span class="largeText">"refused"</span>
      them so <span class="largeText">"often"</span> and left the out so much and did without them so <span class="largeText">"continually"</span>
      that I have come finally to be <span class="largeText">"indifferent"</span> to them I do not now <span class="largeText">"care"</span>
      whether you put them in or <span class="largeText">"not"</span> but for a <span class="largeText">"long"</span> time I felt very <span class="largeText">"definitely"</span>
      about them and would have <span class="largeText">"nothing"</span> to do with them<br><br>
      
      As I say <span class="largeText">"commas"</span> are
      <span class="largeText">"servile"</span> and they have no <span class="largeText">"life"</span> of their own and their use is <span class="largeText">"not"</span> a use it
      is a way of replacing one’s <span class="largeText">"own"</span> interest and I do decidedly <span class="largeText">"like"</span> to like
      my own <span class="largeText">"interest"</span> my own interest in what I am doing A <span class="largeText">"comma"</span> by helping you
      along <span class="largeText">"holding"</span> your coat for you and <span class="largeText">"putting"</span> on your shoes keeps you from
      living your life as <span class="largeText">"actively"</span> as you should lead it and to me for many
      years and I <span class="largeText">"still"</span> do feel that way about it only now I do not <span class="largeText">"pay"</span> as much
      attention to them the use of them was <span class="largeText">"positively"</span> degrading <span class="largeText">"Let"</span> me tell
      you what I <span class="largeText">"feel"</span> and what I <span class="largeText">"mean"</span> and what I <span class="largeText">"felt"</span> and what I <span class="largeText">"meant"</span><br><br>
      
      When I
      was <span class="largeText">"writing"</span> those <span class="largeText">"long"</span> sentences of The Making of Americans verbs <span class="largeText">"active"</span>
      <span class="largeText">"present"</span> verbs with <span class="largeText">"long"</span> dependent adverbial clauses became a <span class="largeText">"passion"</span> with
      me I have told you that I <span class="largeText">"recognize"</span> verbs and adverbs aided by
      <span class="largeText">"prepositions"</span> and <span class="largeText">"conjunctions"</span> with pronouns as <span class="largeText">"possessing"</span> the whole of the
      active life of <span class="largeText">"writing"</span><br><br>
      
      Complications make <span class="largeText">"eventually"</span> for simplicity and
      therefore I have <span class="largeText">"always"</span> liked <span class="largeText">"dependent"</span> adverbial clauses I have liked
      dependent adverbial <span class="largeText">"clauses"</span> because of their <span class="largeText">"variety"</span> of dependence and
      independence You can see how loving the <span class="largeText">"intensity"</span> of complication of
      these things that commas would be <span class="largeText">"degrading"</span> Why if you want the pleasure
      of <span class="largeText">"concentrating"</span> on the final <span class="largeText">"simplicity"</span> of excessive complication would
      you want any artificial <span class="largeText">"aid"</span> to bring about that <span class="largeText">"simplicity"</span> Do you <span class="largeText">"see"</span> now
      why I feel about that <span class="largeText">"simplicity"</span> Do you <span class="largeText">"see"</span> now why I feel about the
      comma as I <span class="largeText">"did"</span> and as I <span class="largeText">"do"</span><br><br>
      
      Think about <span class="largeText">"anything"</span> you <span class="largeText">"really"</span> like to do and
      you will <span class="largeText">"see"</span> what I mean<br><br>
      
      When it gets <span class="largeText">"really"</span> difficult you want to
      <span class="largeText">"disentangle"</span> rather than to <span class="largeText">"cut"</span> the knot at least of anybody feels who is
      <span class="largeText">"working"</span> with any thread so <span class="largeText">"anybody"</span> feels who is working with any tool so
      anybody <span class="largeText">"feels"</span> who is <span class="largeText">"writing"</span> any sentence or reading it after it has been
      written And <span class="largeText">"what"</span> does a comma do a comma does <span class="largeText">"nothing"</span> but make easy a
      thing <span class="largeText">"that"</span> if you like it enough is <span class="largeText">"easy"</span> enough without the comma A long
      <span class="largeText">"complicated"</span> sentence should force itself upon you make you know <span class="largeText">"yourself"</span>
      knowing it and the comma well at the <span class="largeText">"most"</span> a comma is a <span class="largeText">"poor"</span> period that
      lets you stop and take a <span class="largeText">""</span>breath but if you want to take a <span class="largeText">"breath"</span> you ought
      to <span class="largeText">"know"</span> yourself that you <span class="largeText">"want"</span> to take a breath It is <span class="largeText">"not"</span> like stopping
      altogether has something to do with <span class="largeText">""</span>going on but taking a <span class="largeText">"breath"</span> well you
      are <span class="largeText">"always"</span> taking a breath and <span class="largeText">"why"</span> emphasize one breath rather than
      <span class="largeText">"another"</span> breath Anyway <span class="largeText">"that"</span> is the way I felt about it and I felt that
      about it <span class="largeText">"very"</span> very strongly And so I almost <span class="largeText">"never"</span> used a comma The
      <span class="largeText">"longer"</span> the more complicated the sentence the <span class="largeText">"greater"</span> the number of the
      same kinds of words I had following one after another the <span class="largeText">"more"</span> the very
      <span class="largeText">"more"</span> I had of them the more I felt the <span class="largeText">"passionate"</span> need of their taking
      care of themselves <span class="largeText">"by"</span> themselves and <span class="largeText">"not"</span> helping them and <span class="largeText">"thereby"</span>
      <span class="largeText">"enfeebling"</span> them by putting in a comma<br><br>
      
      So <span class="largeText">"that"</span> is the way I felt about
      <span class="largeText">"punctuation"</span> in prose in poetry it is a little <span class="largeText">"different"</span> but more so and
      later I will go into that But <span class="largeText">"that"</span> is the way I felt about <span class="largeText">"punctuation"</span> in
      <span class="largeText">"prose"</span><br><br><br><br>
