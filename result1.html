    <h1 style="padding-left:8rem;">On Punctuation</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
      There are <span class="italicText">some</span> punctuations that are <span class="italicText">interesting</span> and there are <span class="italicText"></span>some
      punctuations that are <span class="italicText">not</span>. Let us begin with the punctuations that are
      <span class="italicText">not</span>. Of these, the one, but the first and the most, the completely most
      <span class="italicText">uninteresting</span>, is the <span class="italicText">question</span> mark. The <span class="italicText">question</span> mark is <span class="italicText">alright</span> when it
      is all alone, when it is used as a brand on cattle, or when it could be used
      in <span class="italicText">decoration</span>, but connected with writing, it is completely, entirely,
      completely, <span class="italicText">uninteresting</span>. It is evident, that is, you ask a "question," you ask
      a <span class="italicText">question</span>, but anybody who can read at all knows when a "question" is a
      <span class="italicText">question</span> as it is written in writing. Therefore, I ask you, therefore,
      wherefore should one use the <span class="italicText">question</span> mark? Beside it does not, in its form,
      go with <span class="italicText">ordinary</span> printing, and so it pleases neither the <span class="italicText">eye</span> nor the <span class="italicText">ear</span>,
      and it is therefore like a noun, just an <span class="italicText">unnecessary</span> name of something. A
      "question" is a <span class="italicText">question</span>; anybody can know that a "question" is a <span class="italicText">question</span>, and
      so why add to it the <span class="italicText">question</span> mark when it is already there, when the
      <span class="italicText">question</span> is already there in the writing. Therefore, I never could bring
      myself to use a <span class="italicText">question</span> mark. I always found it positively revolting, and
      now, very few do use it. <span class="italicText">Exclamation</span> marks have the same difficulty and
      also quotation mark: they are <span class="italicText">unnecessary</span>, they are <span class="italicText">ugly</span>, they spoil the
      line of the writing or the printing, and anyway, what is the use if you do
      not know that a "question" is a <span class="italicText">question</span>? What is the use of its being a
      <span class="italicText">question</span>? The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began
      writing, I found it simply impossible to use <span class="italicText">question</span> marks and <span class="italicText">quotation</span>
      marks and <span class="italicText">exclamation</span> points, and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps
      <span class="italicText">some</span> day they will see it some <span class="italicText">other</span> way, but not at any rate anybody can
      and does see it that way.<br><br>

      So there are the <span class="italicText">uninteresting</span> things in punctuation, <span class="italicText">uninteresting</span> in a way 
      that is perfectly <span class="italicText">obvious</span> and so we do
      not have to go any farther into <span class="italicText">that</span>. There are <span class="italicText">besides</span> dashes and dots,
      and these might be <span class="italicText">interesting</span>; spaces <span class="italicText">might</span> be <span class="italicText">interesting</span>. They might, if
      one <span class="italicText">felt</span> that way about them.<br><br>

      One other <span class="italicText">little</span> punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is 
      the <span class="italicText">apostrophe</span> for <span class="italicText">possession</span>. Well, feel
      as you like about that; I can see, and I do see, that for <span class="italicText">many</span>, that for <span class="italicText">some</span>,
      the possessive case apostrophe has a <span class="italicText">gentle</span>, tender insinuation that makes
      it very difficult to <span class="italicText">definitely</span> decide to do without it. One does do
      <span class="italicText">without</span> it; I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot <span class="italicText"></span>deny that from time to
      time I feel myself having <span class="italicText">regrets</span>, and from time to time, I put it in to
      make the <span class="italicText">possessive</span> case. I <span class="italicText">absolutely</span> do not like it, and leaving it out, I
      feel no <span class="italicText">regret</span> there; it is <span class="italicText">unnecessary</span> and not <span class="italicText">ornamental</span> but inside a
      word, and its <span class="italicText">s</span>...well, <span class="italicText">perhaps</span>, perhaps, it does appeal by its <span class="italicText">weakness</span> to
      your weakness. At least at any rate from <span class="italicText">time</span> to time, I do find myself
      letting it <span class="italicText">alone</span> if it has come in, and sometimes it has come in. I cannot
      <span class="italicText">positively</span> deny, but that I do from <span class="italicText">time</span> to time let it come <span class="italicText">in</span>.<br><br>

      So now to come to the <span class="italicText">real</span> question of <span class="italicText">punctuation</span>: periods, commas, colons,
      semi-colons, and capitals and small letters.<br><br>
      
      I have had a <span class="italicText">long</span> and <span class="italicText">complicated</span> life with all these.<br><br>
      
      Let us begin with <span class="italicText">these</span>. I use the <span class="italicText">least</span> first, and these are <span class="italicText">colons</span> and 
      <span class="italicText">semi-colons</span>, one might add to these <span class="italicText">commas</span>.<br><br>

      When I first began <span class="italicText">writing</span>, I felt that writing should go <span class="italicText">on</span>. I <span class="italicText">still</span> do
      feel that it should go <span class="italicText">on</span>, but when I first began <span class="italicText">writing</span>, I was completely
      possessed by the <span class="italicText">necessity</span> that writing should go <span class="italicText">on</span> and <span class="italicText">on</span> and if writing
      should go <span class="italicText">on</span>, what had <span class="italicText">colons</span> and <span class="italicText">commas</span> to do with it; what had <span class="italicText">periods</span> to
      do with it; what had <span class="italicText">small</span> letters and capitals to do with it; to do with
      writing going <span class="italicText">on</span>, which was at that time the most <span class="italicText">profound</span> need I had in
      connection with <span class="italicText">writing</span>? What had <span class="italicText">colons</span> and <span class="italicText">semi-colons</span> to do with it;
      what had <span class="italicText">commas</span> to do with it; what had <span class="italicText">periods</span> to do with it?<br><br>
      
      What had
      <span class="italicText">periods</span> to do with it? Inevitably no matter how <span class="italicText">completely</span> I had to have
      writing go on, <span class="italicText">physically</span> one had to again and again <span class="italicText">stop</span> sometime and if
      one had to again and again stop <span class="italicText">sometime</span> and if one had to <span class="italicText">again</span> and <span class="italicText">again</span>
      stop <span class="italicText">some</span> time then <span class="italicText">periods</span> had to exist. Beside I had <span class="italicText">always</span> like the
      look of <span class="italicText">periods</span> and I liked what they did. Stopping <span class="italicText"></span>sometime did not
      really keep one from going on, it was nothing that <span class="italicText">interfered</span>, it was only
      something that <span class="italicText">happened</span>, and as it happened as a perfectly <span class="italicText">natural</span>
      happening, I did not believe in <span class="italicText">periods</span> and I used them. I really never
      stopped using them.<br><br>

      Beside that <span class="italicText">periods</span> might later come to have a life of
      their own to commence <span class="italicText">breaking</span> up things in <span class="italicText">arbitrary</span> ways, that has
      happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way;
      later I will read you a little of it. By the <span class="italicText">time</span> I had written this poem
      about three years ago, <span class="italicText">periods</span> had come to have for me completely a life of
      their <span class="italicText">own</span>. They could begin to <span class="italicText">act</span> as they thought <span class="italicText">best</span> and one might
      <span class="italicText">interrupt</span> one's <span class="italicText">writing</span> with them that is not really <span class="italicText">interrupt</span> one's
      <span class="italicText">writing</span> with them but one could come to stop arbitrarily <span class="italicText">stop</span> at times in
      one’s writing and so they could be used and you could use them. Periods
      could come to <span class="italicText">exist</span> in this way, and they could come in this way to have a
      life of their <span class="italicText">own</span>. They did not serve you in any <span class="italicText">servile</span> way as <span class="italicText">commas</span> and
      <span class="italicText">colons</span> and <span class="italicText">semi-colons</span> do. Yes, you do feel what I mean.<br><br>
      
      Periods have a
      <span class="italicText">life</span> of their own, a <span class="italicText">necessity</span> of their own, a <span class="italicText">feeling</span> of their own, a time
      of their own. And that <span class="italicText">feeling</span>, that <span class="italicText">life</span>, that <span class="italicText">necessity</span>, that <span class="italicText">time</span> can
      express itself in an <span class="italicText">infinite</span> variety; that is the <span class="italicText">reason</span> that I have
      always remained true to <span class="italicText">periods</span>, so much so that as I say <span class="italicText">recently</span> I have
      felt that one could need them <span class="italicText">more</span> than one had ever needed them.<br><br>
      
      You can
      <span class="italicText">see</span> what an <span class="italicText">entirely</span> different thing a <span class="italicText">period</span> is from a <span class="italicText">comma</span> a <span class="italicText">colon</span> or
      a <span class="italicText">semi-colon</span>.<br><br>
      
      There are two <span class="italicText">different</span> ways of thinking about <span class="italicText">colons</span> and
      <span class="italicText">semi-colons</span>: you can think of them as <span class="italicText">commas</span>, and as such they are purely
      <span class="italicText">servile</span>, or you can think of them as <span class="italicText">periods</span> and then using them can make
      you feel <span class="italicText">adventurous</span>. I can see that one might feel about them as <span class="italicText">periods</span>,
      but I myself never have; I began <span class="italicText">unfortunately</span> to feel them as a <span class="italicText">comma</span>, and
      commas are <span class="italicText">servile</span>: they have no <span class="italicText">life</span> of their own, they are <span class="italicText">dependent</span> upon
      use and <span class="italicText">convenience</span>, and they are put there just for <span class="italicText">practical</span> purposes.
      Semi-colons and colons had for me from the <span class="italicText">first</span> completely; this character,
      the <span class="italicText">character</span> that a comma has and not the <span class="italicText">character</span> that a period has and
      therefore and definitely I have <span class="italicText">never</span> used them. But now <span class="italicText">dimly</span> and
      definitely, I do see that they might, well, possibly, they might have in them
      something of the <span class="italicText">character</span> of the period, and so it might have been an
      <span class="italicText">adventure</span> to use them. I really do not think so; I think however <span class="italicText">lively</span>
      they are or <span class="italicText">disguised</span> they are, they are definitely more <span class="italicText">comma</span> than period
      and so really I cannot <span class="italicText">regret</span> not having used them. They are more <span class="italicText">powerful</span>,
      more <span class="italicText">imposing</span>, more <span class="italicText">pretentious</span> than a comma, but they are a comma all the
      same. They really have <span class="italicText">within</span> them, deeply within them, fundamentally within
      them, the <span class="italicText">comma</span> nature. And now <span class="italicText">what</span> does a comma do, and what has it to do
      and <span class="italicText">why</span> do I feel as I do about them?<br><br>
      
      What does a <span class="italicText">comma</span> do?<br><br>
      
      I have <span class="italicText">refused</span>
      them so often and left them out so much and did <span class="italicText">without</span> them so continually
      that I have come finally to be <span class="italicText">indifferent</span> to them. I do not now care
      whether you put them <span class="italicText">in</span> or <span class="italicText">not</span>, but for a long time, I felt very <span class="italicText">definitely</span>
      about them and would have <span class="italicText">nothing</span> to do with them.<br><br>
      
      As I say commas are
      <span class="italicText">servile</span> and they have no <span class="italicText">life</span> of their own, and their use is not a use; it
      is a way of replacing one’s own interest, and I do decidedly like to, like
      my own <span class="italicText">interest</span>, my own interest in what I am doing. A comma by <span class="italicText">helping</span> you
      along, <span class="italicText">holding</span> your coat for you, and <span class="italicText">putting</span> on your shoes keeps you from
      living your life as <span class="italicText">actively</span> as you should lead it, and to me, for many
      years, and I still do feel that way about it, only now I do not pay as much
      <span class="italicText">attention</span> to them; the use of them was positively <span class="italicText">degrading</span>! Let me tell
      you what I <span class="italicText">feel</span> and what I <span class="italicText">mean</span>, and what I felt and what I meant.<br><br>
      
      When I
      was writing those <span class="italicText">long</span> sentences of The Making of Americans, <span class="italicText">verbs</span>, active
      present <span class="italicText">verbs</span> with long dependent <span class="italicText">adverbial</span> clauses, became a passion with
      me. I have told you that I recognize <span class="italicText">verbs</span> and <span class="italicText">adverbs</span> aided by
      <span class="italicText">prepositions</span> and <span class="italicText">conjunctions</span> with pronouns as possessing the whole of the
      <span class="italicText">active</span> life of writing.<br><br>
      
      <span class="italicText">Complications</span> make eventually for <span class="italicText">simplicity</span> and
      therefore, I have always liked dependent <span class="italicText">adverbial</span> clauses. I have liked
      dependent <span class="italicText">adverbial</span> clauses because of their <span class="italicText">variety</span> of dependence and
      independence. You can see how loving the <span class="italicText">intensity</span> of complication of
      these things that commas would be <span class="italicText">degrading</span>. Why if you want the pleasure
      of <span class="italicText">concentrating</span> on the final <span class="italicText">simplicity</span> of excessive complication would
      you want any <span class="italicText">artificial</span> aid to bring about that <span class="italicText">simplicity</span>? Do you see now
      why I feel about that <span class="italicText">simplicity</span>? Do you see now why I feel about the
      <span class="italicText">comma</span> as I did and as I do?<br><br>
      
      Think about <span class="italicText">anything</span> you really <span class="italicText">like</span> to do and
      you will see what I <span class="italicText">mean</span>.<br><br>
      
      When it gets really <span class="italicText">difficult</span>, you want to
      <span class="italicText">disentangle</span> rather than to <span class="italicText">cut</span> the knot, at least of anybody feels who is
      working with any <span class="italicText">thread</span>, so anybody feels who is <span class="italicText">working</span> with any tool, so
      anybody feels who is <span class="italicText">writing</span> any sentence or <span class="italicText">reading</span> it after it has been
      written. And what does a comma <span class="italicText">do</span>; a comma does <span class="italicText">nothing</span> but make easy a
      thing that if you like it <span class="italicText">enough</span> is easy enough without the comma. A long
      <span class="italicText">complicated</span> sentence should <span class="italicText">force</span> itself upon you, make you know yourself
      knowing it and the comma, well, at the <span class="italicText">most</span>, a comma is a <span class="italicText">poor</span> period that
      lets you stop and take a <span class="italicText">breath</span>, but if you want to take a breath you ought
      to know yourself that you <span class="italicText">want</span> to take a <span class="italicText">breath</span>. It is not like <span class="italicText">stopping</span>
      altogether has <span class="italicText">something</span> to do with going on, but taking a breath; well, you
      are always taking a <span class="italicText">breath</span>, and why <span class="italicText">emphasize</span> one breath rather than
      <span class="italicText">another</span> breath? Anyway, that is the way I felt about it, and I felt that
      about it very, very <span class="italicText">strongly</span>. And so I almost <span class="italicText">never</span> used a comma. The
      <span class="italicText">longer</span>, the more <span class="italicText">complicated</span> the sentence; the <span class="italicText">greater</span> the number of the
      same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more, the very
      <span class="italicText">more</span> I had of them, the more I felt the <span class="italicText">passionate</span> need of their taking
      care of themselves by themselves and not helping them and thereby
      <span class="italicText">enfeebling</span> them by putting in a comma.<br><br>
      
      So <span class="italicText">that</span> is the way I felt about
      <span class="italicText">punctuation</span> in prose; in poetry, it is a little different but more so and
      later I will go into that. But that is the way I felt about <span class="italicText">punctuation</span> in
      prose.
