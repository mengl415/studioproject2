    <h1 style="padding-left: 8rem">On Punctuation</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">
      There are <span class="italicText">some</span> punctuations that are
      <span class="italicText">interesting</span> and there are
      <span class="italicText"></span>some punctuations that are
      <span class="italicText">not</span><span class="largeText">.</span> Let us
      begin with the punctuations that are <span class="italicText">not</span
      ><span class="largeText">.</span> Of these<span class="largeText">,</span>
      the one<span class="largeText">,</span> but the first and the most<span class="largeText">,</span>
      the completely most <span class="italicText">uninteresting</span
      ><span class="largeText">,</span> is the 
      <span class="italicText">question</span> mark<span class="largeText">.</span>
      The <span class="italicText">question</span> mark is
      <span class="italicText">alright</span> when it is all alone<span class="largeText">,</span>
      when it is used as a brand on cattle<span class="largeText">,</span> or
      when it could be used in <span class="italicText">decoration</span
      ><span class="largeText">,</span></span> but connected with writing<span class="largeText">,</span>
      it is completely<span class="largeText">,</span> entirely<span class="largeText">,</span>
      completely<span class="largeText">,</span>
      <span class="italicText">uninteresting</span
      ><span class="largeText">.</span></span> It is evident<span class="largeText">,</span> that is<span class="largeText">,</span> you ask a
     <span class="largeText">"</span>question<span class="largeText">,"</span> you ask a
      <span class="italicText">question</span><span class="largeText">,</span>
      but anybody who can read at all knows when a
      <span class="largeText">"</span>question<span class="largeText">"</span> is a
      <span class="italicText">question</span> as it is written in writing<span class="largeText">.</span> Therefore<span class="largeText">,</span> I ask you<span class="largeText">,</span> therefore<span class="largeText">,</span> wherefore should one use the
      <span class="italicText">question</span> mark<span class="largeText">?</span> Beside it does not<span class="largeText">,</span> in its form<span class="largeText">,</span> go with <span class="italicText">ordinary</span> printing<span class="largeText">,</span> and so it pleases neither the <span class="italicText">eye</span> nor
      the <span class="italicText">ear</span><span class="largeText">,</span>
      and it is therefore like a noun<span class="largeText">,</span> just an
      <span class="italicText">unnecessary</span> name of something<span class="largeText">.</span> A <span class="largeText">"</span>question<span class="largeText">"</span> is a <span class="italicText">question</span
      ><span class="largeText">;</span> anybody can know that a 
     <span class="largeText">"</span>question<span class="largeText">"</span>
      is a <span class="italicText">question</span
      ><span class="largeText">,</span> and so why add to it the
      <span class="italicText">question</span> mark when it is already
      there<span class="largeText">,</span> when the
      <span class="italicText">question</span> is already there in the
      writing<span class="largeText">?</span> Therefore<span class="largeText">,</span> I never could bring myself to use a
      <span class="italicText">question</span> mark<span class="largeText">.</span> I always found it positively revolting<span class="largeText">,</span>
      and now<span class="largeText">,</span> very few do use it<span class="largeText">.</span> <span class="italicText">Exclamation</span> marks have the same
      difficulty and also quotation mark<span class="largeText">:</span> they
      are <span class="italicText">unnecessary</span
      ><span class="largeText">,</span> they are
      <span class="italicText">ugly</span><span class="largeText">,</span> they
      spoil the line of the writing or the printing<span class="largeText">,</span> and anyway<span class="largeText">,</span></span> what is the use if you do
      not know that a <span class="largeText">"</span>question<span class="largeText">"</span> is a <span class="italicText">question</span
      ><span class="largeText">?</span> What is the use of its being a
      <span class="italicText">question</span><span class="largeText">?</span>
      The same thing is true of a quotation<span class="largeText">.</span> When
      I first began writing<span class="largeText">,</span> I found it simply
      impossible to use <span class="italicText">question</span> marks and
      <span class="italicText">quotation</span> marks and
      <span class="italicText">exclamation</span> points<span class="largeText">,</span> and now anybody sees it that way<span class="largeText">.</span></span>
      Perhaps <span class="italicText">some</span> day they will see it some
      <span class="italicText">other</span> way<span class="largeText">,</span>
      but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      So there are the <span class="italicText">uninteresting</span> things in
      punctuation<span class="largeText">,</span> <span class="italicText">uninteresting</span> in a way that
      is perfectly <span class="italicText">obvious</span> and so we do not have
      to go any farther into <span class="italicText">that</span><span class="largeText">.</span> There are
      <span class="italicText">besides</span> dashes and dots<span class="largeText">,</span> and these might
      be <span class="italicText">interesting</span><span class="largeText">;</span> spaces
      <span class="italicText">might</span> be
      <span class="italicText">interesting</span><span class="largeText">.</span> They might<span class="largeText">,</span> if one
      <span class="italicText">felt</span> that way about them<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      One other <span class="italicText">little</span> punctuation mark one can
      have feelings about and that is the
      <span class="italicText">apostrophe</span> for
      <span class="italicText">possession</span><span class="largeText">.</span> Well<span class="largeText">,</span> feel as you like about
      that<span class="largeText">;</span> I can see<span class="largeText">,</span> and I do see<span class="largeText">,</span> that for
      <span class="italicText">many</span><span class="largeText">,</span> that for
      <span class="italicText">some</span><span class="largeText">,</span> the possessive case apostrophe has a
      <span class="italicText">gentle</span><span class="largeText">,</span> tender insinuation that makes it
      very difficult to <span class="italicText">definitely</span> decide to do
      without it<span class="largeText">.</span> One does do <span class="italicText">without</span> it<span class="largeText">;</span> I do<span class="largeText">,</span>
      I mostly always do<span class="largeText">,</span> but I cannot <span class="italicText"></span>deny that
      from time to time I feel myself having
      <span class="italicText">regrets</span><span class="largeText">,</span> and from time to time<span class="largeText">,</span> I put it
      in to make the <span class="italicText">possessive</span> case<span class="largeText">.</span> I
      <span class="italicText">absolutely</span> do not like it<span class="largeText">,</span> and leaving it
      out<span class="largeText">,</span> I feel no <span class="italicText">regret</span> there<span class="largeText">;</span> it is
      <span class="italicText">unnecessary</span> and not
      <span class="italicText">ornamental</span> but inside a word<span class="largeText">,</span> and its
      <span class="italicText">s</span><span class="largeText">.</span><span class="largeText">.</span><span class="largeText">.</span>well<span class="largeText">,</span>
      <span class="italicText">perhaps</span><span class="largeText">,</span> perhaps<span class="largeText">,</span> it does appeal by its
      <span class="italicText">weakness</span> to your weakness<span class="largeText">.</span> At least at any
      rate from <span class="italicText">time</span> to time<span class="largeText">,</span> I do find myself
      letting it <span class="italicText">alone</span> if it has come in<span class="largeText">,</span> and
      sometimes it has come in<span class="largeText">.</span> I cannot
      <span class="italicText">positively</span> deny<span class="largeText">,</span> but that I do from
      <span class="italicText">time</span> to time let it come
      <span class="italicText">in</span><span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      So now to come to the <span class="italicText">real</span> question of
      <span class="italicText">punctuation</span><span class="largeText">:</span> periods<span class="largeText">,</span> commas<span class="largeText">,</span> colons<span class="largeText">,</span>
      semi-colons<span class="largeText">,</span> and capitals and small letters<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      I have had a <span class="italicText">long</span> and
      <span class="italicText">complicated</span> life with all these<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      Let us begin with <span class="italicText">these</span><span class="largeText">.</span> I use the
      <span class="italicText">least</span> first<span class="largeText">,</span> and these are
      <span class="italicText">colons</span> and
      <span class="italicText">semi-colons</span><span class="largeText">,</span> one might add to these
      <span class="italicText">commas</span><span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      When I first began <span class="italicText">writing</span><span class="largeText">,</span> I felt that
      writing should go <span class="italicText">on</span><span class="largeText">.</span> I
      <span class="italicText">still</span> do feel that it should go
      <span class="italicText">on</span><span class="largeText">,</span> but when I first began
      <span class="italicText">writing</span><span class="largeText">,</span> I was completely possessed by the
      <span class="italicText">necessity</span> that writing should go
      <span class="italicText">on</span> and
      <span class="italicText">on</span> and if writing should go
      <span class="italicText">on</span><span class="largeText">,</span> what had
      <span class="italicText">colons</span> and
      <span class="italicText">commas</span> to do with it<span class="largeText">;</span> what had
      <span class="italicText">periods</span> to do with it<span class="largeText">;</span> what had
      <span class="italicText">small</span> letters and capitals to do with it<span class="largeText">;</span>
      to do with writing going <span class="italicText">on</span><span class="largeText">,</span> which was at
      that time the most <span class="italicText">profound</span> need I had in
      connection with <span class="italicText">writing</span><span class="largeText">?</span> What had
      <span class="italicText">colons</span> and
      <span class="italicText">semi-colons</span> to do with it<span class="largeText">;</span> what had
      <span class="italicText">commas</span> to do with it<span class="largeText">;</span> what had
      <span class="italicText">periods</span> to do with it<span class="largeText">?</span><br /><br />

      What had
      <span class="italicText">periods</span> to do with it<span class="largeText">?</span> Inevitably no
      matter how <span class="italicText">completely</span> I had to have
      writing go on<span class="largeText">,</span> <span class="italicText">physically</span> one had to again
      and again <span class="italicText">stop</span> sometime and if one had to
      again and again stop <span class="italicText">sometime</span> and if one
      had to <span class="italicText">again</span> and
      <span class="italicText">again</span> stop
      <span class="italicText">some</span> time then
      <span class="italicText">periods</span> had to exist<span class="largeText">.</span> Beside I had
      <span class="italicText">always</span> like the look of
      <span class="italicText">periods</span> and I liked what they did<span class="largeText">.</span>
      Stopping <span class="italicText"></span>sometime did not really keep one
      from going on<span class="largeText">,</span> it was nothing that
      <span class="italicText">interfered</span><span class="largeText">,</span> it was only something that
      <span class="italicText">happened</span><span class="largeText">,</span> and as it happened as a
      perfectly <span class="italicText">natural</span> happening<span class="largeText">,</span> I did not
      believe in <span class="italicText">periods</span> and I used them<span class="largeText">.</span> I
      really never stopped using them<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      Beside that <span class="italicText">periods</span> might later come to
      have a life of their own to commence
      <span class="italicText">breaking</span> up things in
      <span class="italicText">arbitrary</span> ways<span class="largeText">,</span> that has happened lately
      with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way<span class="largeText">;</span> later I will read
      you a little of it<span class="largeText">.</span> By the <span class="italicText">time</span> I had
      written this poem about three years ago<span class="largeText">,</span>
      <span class="italicText">periods</span> had come to have for me completely
      a life of their <span class="italicText">own</span><span class="largeText">.</span> They could begin to
      <span class="italicText">act</span> as they thought
      <span class="italicText">best</span> and one might
      <span class="italicText">interrupt</span> one's
      <span class="italicText">writing</span> with them that is not really
      <span class="italicText">interrupt</span> one's
      <span class="italicText">writing</span> with them but one could come to
      stop arbitrarily <span class="italicText">stop</span> at times in one’s
      writing and so they could be used and you could use them<span class="largeText">.</span> Periods could
      come to <span class="italicText">exist</span> in this way<span class="largeText">,</span> and they could
      come in this way to have a life of their
      <span class="italicText">own</span><span class="largeText">.</span> They did not serve you in any
      <span class="italicText">servile</span> way as
      <span class="italicText">commas</span> and
      <span class="italicText">colons</span> and
      <span class="italicText">semi-colons</span> do<span class="largeText">.</span> Yes<span class="largeText">,</span> you do feel what I
      mean<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      Periods have a
      <span class="italicText">life</span> of their own<span class="largeText">,</span> a
      <span class="italicText">necessity</span> of their own<span class="largeText">,</span> a
      <span class="italicText">feeling</span> of their own<span class="largeText">,</span> a time of their own<span class="largeText">.</span>
      And that <span class="italicText">feeling</span><span class="largeText">,</span> that
      <span class="italicText">life</span><span class="largeText">,</span> that
      <span class="italicText">necessity</span><span class="largeText">,</span> that
      <span class="italicText">time</span> can express itself in an
      <span class="italicText">infinite</span> variety<span class="largeText">;</span> that is the
      <span class="italicText">reason</span> that I have always remained true to
      <span class="italicText">periods</span><span class="largeText">,</span> so much so that as I say
      <span class="italicText">recently</span> I have felt that one could need
      them <span class="italicText">more</span> than one had ever needed
      them<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      You can
      <span class="italicText">see</span> what an
      <span class="italicText">entirely</span> different thing a
      <span class="italicText">period</span> is from a
      <span class="italicText">comma</span> a
      <span class="italicText">colon</span> or a
      <span class="italicText">semi-colon</span><span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      There are two <span class="italicText">different</span> ways of thinking
      about <span class="italicText">colons</span> and
      <span class="italicText">semi-colons</span><span class="largeText">:</span> you can think of them as
      <span class="italicText">commas</span><span class="largeText">,</span> and as such they are purely
      <span class="italicText">servile</span><span class="largeText">,</span> or you can think of them as
      <span class="italicText">periods</span> and then using them can make you
      feel <span class="italicText">adventurous</span><span class="largeText">.</span> I can see that one might
      feel about them as <span class="italicText">periods</span><span class="largeText">,</span> but I myself
      never have<span class="largeText">;</span> I began <span class="italicText">unfortunately</span> to feel
      them as a <span class="italicText">comma</span><span class="largeText">,</span> and commas are
      <span class="italicText">servile</span><span class="largeText">:</span> they have no
      <span class="italicText">life</span> of their own<span class="largeText">,</span> they are
      <span class="italicText">dependent</span> upon use and
      <span class="italicText">convenience</span><span class="largeText">,</span> and they are put there just
      for <span class="italicText">practical</span> purposes<span class="largeText">.</span> Semi-colons and
      colons had for me from the
      <span class="italicText">first</span> completely<span class="largeText">;</span> this character<span class="largeText">,</span> the
      <span class="italicText">character</span> that a comma has and not the
      <span class="italicText">character</span> that a period has and therefore
      and definitely I have <span class="italicText">never</span> used them<span class="largeText">.</span> But
      now <span class="italicText">dimly</span> and definitely<span class="largeText">,</span> I do see that
      they might<span class="largeText">,</span> well<span class="largeText">,</span> possibly<span class="largeText">,</span> they might have in them something of the
      <span class="italicText">character</span> of the period<span class="largeText">,</span> and so it might
      have been an <span class="italicText">adventure</span> to use them<span class="largeText">.</span> I
      really do not think so<span class="largeText">;</span> I think however
      <span class="italicText">lively</span> they are or
      <span class="italicText">disguised</span> they are<span class="largeText">,</span> they are definitely
      more <span class="italicText">comma</span> than period and so really I
      cannot <span class="italicText">regret</span> not having used them<span class="largeText">.</span> They
      are more <span class="italicText">powerful</span><span class="largeText">,</span> more
      <span class="italicText">imposing</span><span class="largeText">,</span> more
      <span class="italicText">pretentious</span> than a comma<span class="largeText">,</span> but they are a
      comma all the same<span class="largeText">.</span> They really have
      <span class="italicText">within</span> them<span class="largeText">,</span> deeply within them<span class="largeText">,</span>
      fundamentally within them<span class="largeText">,</span> the
      <span class="italicText">comma</span> nature<span class="largeText">.</span> And now
      <span class="italicText">what</span> does a comma do<span class="largeText">,</span> and what has it to
      do and <span class="italicText">why</span> do I feel as I do about
      them<span class="largeText">?</span><br /><br />

      What does a <span class="italicText">comma</span> do<span class="largeText">?</span><br /><br />

      I have <span class="italicText">refused</span> them so often and left them
      out so much and did <span class="italicText">without</span> them so
      continually that I have come finally to be
      <span class="italicText">indifferent</span> to them<span class="largeText">.</span> I do not now care
      whether you put them <span class="italicText">in</span> or
      <span class="italicText">not</span><span class="largeText">,</span> but for a long time<span class="largeText">,</span> I felt very
      <span class="italicText">definitely</span> about them and would have
      <span class="italicText">nothing</span> to do with them<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      As I say commas are
      <span class="italicText">servile</span> and they have no
      <span class="italicText">life</span> of their own<span class="largeText">,</span> and their use is not a
      use<span class="largeText">;</span> it is a way of replacing one’s own interest<span class="largeText">,</span> and I do decidedly like
      to<span class="largeText">,</span> like my own <span class="italicText">interest</span><span class="largeText">,</span> my own interest
      in what I am doing<span class="largeText">.</span> A comma by <span class="italicText">helping</span> you
      along<span class="largeText">,</span> <span class="italicText">holding</span> your coat for you<span class="largeText">,</span> and
      <span class="italicText">putting</span> on your shoes keeps you from
      living your life as <span class="italicText">actively</span> as you should
      lead it<span class="largeText">,</span> and to me<span class="largeText">,</span> for many years<span class="largeText">,</span> and I still do feel that way about it<span class="largeText">,</span>
      only now I do not pay as much <span class="italicText">attention</span> to
      them<span class="largeText">;</span> the use of them was positively
      <span class="italicText">degrading</span><span class="largeText">!</span> Let me tell you what I
      <span class="italicText">feel</span> and what I
      <span class="italicText">mean</span><span class="largeText">,</span> and what I felt and what I meant<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      When I was writing those <span class="italicText">long</span> sentences of
      The Making of Americans<span class="largeText">,</span> <span class="italicText">verbs</span><span class="largeText">,</span> active
      present <span class="italicText">verbs</span> with long dependent
      <span class="italicText">adverbial</span> clauses<span class="largeText">,</span> became a passion with
      me<span class="largeText">.</span> I have told you that I recognize
      <span class="italicText">verbs</span> and
      <span class="italicText">adverbs</span> aided by
      <span class="italicText">prepositions</span> and
      <span class="italicText">conjunctions</span> with pronouns as possessing
      the whole of the <span class="italicText">active</span> life of
      writing<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      <span class="italicText">Complications</span> make eventually for
      <span class="italicText">simplicity</span> and therefore<span class="largeText">,</span> I have always
      liked dependent <span class="italicText">adverbial</span> clauses<span class="largeText">.</span> I have
      liked dependent <span class="italicText">adverbial</span> clauses because
      of their <span class="italicText">variety</span> of dependence and
      independence<span class="largeText">.</span> You can see how loving the
      <span class="italicText">intensity</span> of complication of these things
      that commas would be <span class="italicText">degrading</span><span class="largeText">.</span> Why if you
      want the pleasure of <span class="italicText">concentrating</span> on the
      final <span class="italicText">simplicity</span> of excessive complication
      would you want any <span class="italicText">artificial</span> aid to bring
      about that <span class="italicText">simplicity</span><span class="largeText">?</span> Do you see now why
      I feel about that <span class="italicText">simplicity</span><span class="largeText">?</span> Do you see
      now why I feel about the <span class="italicText">comma</span> as I did
      and as I do<span class="largeText">?</span><br /><br />

      Think about <span class="italicText">anything</span> you really
      <span class="italicText">like</span> to do and you will see what I
      <span class="italicText">mean</span><span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      When it gets really <span class="italicText">difficult</span><span class="largeText">,</span> you want to
      <span class="italicText">disentangle</span> rather than to
      <span class="italicText">cut</span> the knot<span class="largeText">,</span> at least of anybody feels
      who is working with any <span class="italicText">thread</span><span class="largeText">,</span> so anybody
      feels who is <span class="italicText">working</span> with any tool<span class="largeText">,</span> so
      anybody feels who is <span class="italicText">writing</span> any sentence
      or <span class="italicText">reading</span> it after it has been written<span class="largeText">.</span>
      And what does a comma <span class="italicText">do</span><span class="largeText">;</span> a comma does
      <span class="italicText">nothing</span> but make easy a thing that if you
      like it <span class="italicText">enough</span> is easy enough without the
      comma<span class="largeText">.</span> A long <span class="italicText">complicated</span> sentence should
      <span class="italicText">force</span> itself upon you<span class="largeText">,</span> make you know
      yourself knowing it and the comma<span class="largeText">,</span> well<span class="largeText">,</span> at the
      <span class="italicText">most</span><span class="largeText">,</span> a comma is a
      <span class="italicText">poor</span> period that lets you stop and take a
      <span class="italicText">breath</span><span class="largeText">,</span> but if you want to take a breath
      you ought to know yourself that you
      <span class="italicText">want</span> to take a
      <span class="italicText">breath</span><span class="largeText">.</span> It is not like
      <span class="italicText">stopping</span> altogether has
      <span class="italicText">something</span> to do with going on<span class="largeText">,</span> but taking
      a breath<span class="largeText">;</span> well<span class="largeText">,</span> you are always taking a
      <span class="italicText">breath</span><span class="largeText">,</span> and why
      <span class="italicText">emphasize</span> one breath rather than
      <span class="italicText">another</span> breath<span class="largeText">?</span> Anyway<span class="largeText">,</span> that is the way I
      felt about it<span class="largeText">,</span> and I felt that about it very<span class="largeText">,</span> very
      <span class="italicText">strongly</span><span class="largeText">.</span> And so I almost
      <span class="italicText">never</span> used a comma<span class="largeText">.</span> The
      <span class="italicText">longer</span><span class="largeText">,</span> the more
      <span class="italicText">complicated</span> the sentence<span class="largeText">;</span> the
      <span class="italicText">greater</span> the number of the same kinds of
      words I had following one after another<span class="largeText">,</span> the more<span class="largeText">,</span> the very
      <span class="italicText">more</span> I had of them<span class="largeText">,</span> the more I felt the
      <span class="italicText">passionate</span> need of their taking care of
      themselves by themselves and not helping them and thereby
      <span class="italicText">enfeebling</span> them by putting in a comma<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br />

      So <span class="italicText">that</span> is the way I felt about
      <span class="italicText">punctuation</span> in prose<span class="largeText">;</span> in poetry<span class="largeText">,</span> it is a
      little different but more so and later I will go into that<span class="largeText">.</span> But that is
      the way I felt about <span class="italicText">punctuation</span> in
      prose<span class="largeText">.</span><br /><br /><br /><br />
